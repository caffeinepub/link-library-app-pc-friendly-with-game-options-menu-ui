  "summary": "The diff appears to implement a permanently dark theme by forcing the `dark` class/color-scheme at runtime and by making the CSS tokens identical for `:root` and `.dark`, and it removes/neutralizes background translucency by using an opaque overlay in the layout. Some additional global visual tweaks (focus rings/transitions) were introduced beyond the stated theme-stabilization scope.",

    {
      "description": "Added global focus-visible ring styling and ring-offset behavior (\"Enhanced focus states for game menu feel\").",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-10/REQ-11 (theme locking and removing scroll-dependent color shifts), and may be considered extra UI behavior beyond stabilizing theme during scrolling.",

      "description": "Added global transition styling for interactive elements (\"Smooth transitions for interactive elements\" applying transition-colors to buttons/links).",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-10/REQ-11; introduces additional visual behavior not necessary for locking the theme or preventing scroll-triggered color shifts.",
