# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Lock the UI to a permanent black/white dark theme and eliminate scroll-related visual effects that cause perceived color changes.

**Planned changes:**
- Enforce a consistent dark theme (black/near-black background, white text, white accents) across the app regardless of system theme.
- Remove/neutralize any scroll-dependent styling (e.g., translucent overlays, backdrop blur, opacity changes) that causes the background or panels to appear to shift color during scrolling.
- Ensure scrollable areas (main page and links list) keep stable background/text/accent colors while scrolling.

**User-visible outcome:** The app always displays a solid black/white dark UI, and scrolling no longer changes or shifts the perceived colors anywhere in the interface.
